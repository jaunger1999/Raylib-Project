# Zoomy Engine

This is Zoomy Engine! A 3D Game/Engine hybrid designed to bridge the gap between play and creation for the current era.

I love playing games. I love making games. And I want other people to get the same kind of joy I do in the process of both play and creation.
Making games is hard. If you've ever opened up a game engine you may have thought to yourself "where do I even begin?" and closed it.
Or maybe you started working on a project and discovered there's waaaay more technical work involved than you bargained for.

What a game can do is offer a set of general purpose tools that streamline this process: collision, physics, assets, scripts, for example.

The game that does the absolute best job of this is Doom (1993). Doom is open-source, has a very straightforward format for making your own levels, and a very fun set of mechanics to build on top of.
The problem is, it's over 30 years old, and comes with many limitations and hard-coded mechanics (necessary just to make the game run at the time) that make it a bit more difficult to work with than it could be. The Eternity Engine and GZDoom, both offshoots of the Doom engine, add many features to make it a more general purpose engine. They're both incredible projects, but suffer from the fact that they're building on top of an extremely old code-base.

That's where Zoomy Engine comes in. It's built from the ground up to have a set of general purpose mechanics that support any genre and an embedded scripting language (Lua) for game-specific mechanics.

The project is written entirely in the C99 standard to maximize portability.

## Getting Started

The project is still in its early phases, so there's not much to see here.

## Usage

Will add later.

## Contributing

You're more than welcome to submit pull requests, though its still too early for me to give people direction on how to contribute.
